        Adobe <!--use for giving spaces as "   " won't work--> &nbsp; Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g."to photoshop an image", "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest") although Adobe discourages such use.[5] Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone.

    <!--can also use <br> tag to break the paragraph-->
    <p>
        Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or enhanced features.

    <p>If you’re new to Adobe Photoshop, you may feel a little overwhelmed by the number of panels, icons, and tools you see on the screen. Adobe creates some of the most robust and intricate software on the market, which gives you plenty of options. But it also creates a steep learning curve, with lots to practice and discover. Here are five Photoshop tips and tricks to help you make the most of your experience. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Learn keyboard shortcuts</h3>
            <p>Experienced Photoshoppers do their image editing quickly and easily thanks to a collection of useful keyboard shortcuts. Rather than searching through dropdown menus and submenus (which can feel especially complicated when new Photoshop updates come out), it’s helpful to learn shortcuts for the tasks you’re more likely to perform frequently. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Always perform destructive edits on new layers</h3>
            <p>If you’re used to working in Lightroom, you’ve already put in your time performing non-destructive edits. Essentially, adjustment layers you use in Lightroom don’t change the photos themselves. The edits exist as a separate file, so you can always revert to the original image with no harm done.
            <p>Photoshop can work that way too, as long as you prepare your file and workspace correctly. When you open an image, it will appear as the Background layer. To keep that image intact and unchanged, make a copy of it by choosing Layer > New > Layer from Background. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Save your Photoshop files correctly for future editing</h3>
            <p>Even the most experienced retouchers will occasionally flatten the layers of an image and save in the wrong format from time to time. It can be incredibly frustrating to want to tweak one minor aspect of your project, but only have a flattened jpg to work with.</p>
            <p>  To avoid future headaches, save a PSD file of your most complicated editing projects.<a href = "https://fileinfo.com/extension/psd#:~:text=A%20PSD%20file%20is%20an,to%20save%20files%20in%20Photoshop.&text=You%20can%20modify%20PSD%20layers,shapes%2C%20text%2C%20and%20effects." target="_blank"> PSD files</a> preserve your layers individually so you can return to them at any time for future photo editing and adjustments. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Practice using layer masks</h3>
            <p>Layer masks are one of the most powerful Photoshop tools. Masks make it possible to hide any portion of a layer, and you can use them on as many layers as you need.</p>
            <p>For example, if you’re editing a portrait and you want to brighten the eyes, you can select just the areas you want to brighten by using a layer mask. If you want to soften the shadows on the face, you can add a second layer mask to perform that task. Add additional layer masks for darkening the background or tweaking the hair color. The sky’s the limit.</p>
            <p>The flexibility and reversibility of editing with masks makes them one of the most important skills to practice in Photoshop. The sooner you get the hang of them, the smoother your editing sessions will be.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Find what works for you and create a consistent workflow</h3>
            <p>It’s important to remember that there are many different ways to achieve the same results in Photoshop. There is no single correct path for editing a photo. Video tutorials may tell you different techniques to get the same effect, but the best option is the one you can perform over and over again comfortably.</p>
